## Getting Started
Welcome to my Hangman game made entirely of Javascript in Nodejs

### Prerequisites

Clone the repo to your local machine. 
cd into the hangman directory and install the required npm packages

```
npm install
```

Packages used: [readline-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync)

### Instructions
To start the game, type: 

```
node . 
```

Words are chosen at random.
Only the letters A - Z will be accepted. 
The user will get 6 incorrect guesses before that round is over.
A duplicate incorrect guess will not count against the user.
Each round will start automatically after the first round is finished. 
The user can quit at any time by typing CTRL-C.

GOODLUCK!
